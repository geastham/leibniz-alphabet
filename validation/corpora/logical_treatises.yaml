# Canonical Corpus of Logical Treatises
# =====================================
# A fixed body of concepts from foundational logical and philosophical works
# used to measure the alphabet's expressiveness and encoding efficiency.
#
# Each concept includes:
#   - source: The treatise/work it comes from
#   - decomposition: Suggested primitive composition (using our alphabet)
#   - complexity: Estimated number of primitives needed
#   - canonical: Whether this is a foundational concept in the source work
