      - approach: "temporal-quality analysis"
        attempt: "Change = different qualities at different times"
        result: "Change(A,P→Q) = ∃A(t1) ∧ ∃A(t2) ∧ t1≺t2 ∧ P(A,t1) ∧ Q(A,t2) ∧ P≠Q. Uses existence, identity, succession, quality, negation."
        survived: false
      - approach: "process-becoming analysis"
        attempt: "Maybe the 'becoming' aspect isn't captured by mere succession"
        result: "Becoming = the identity-preserving transition through successive states. The 'process' is just continuous change - limit of successive discrete changes."
        survived: false
      - approach: "Heraclitean flux"
        attempt: "Everything flows - maybe flux is more basic than static being"
        result: "Flux = continuous change = our derivation applied at every instant. No new primitive needed for the 'flow' - it's composition of moments of change."
        survived: false
    survived: false
    notes: "Change fully decomposes to: same entity + different times + different qualities. The Heraclitean 'becoming' is not lost - it's captured by the structure."

  edge_cases:
    cases_found:
      - case: "Cambridge change (mere relational change)"
        severity: "low"
        analysis: "Socrates becomes shorter than Theaetetus when Theaetetus grows. Expressible: relational quality changes due to change in relatum."
      - case: "Substantial change (coming-to-be and passing-away)"
        severity: "medium"
        analysis: "Birth = existence begins. Death = existence ends. Change in existence itself. Expressible: ¬∃A(t1) ∧ ∃A(t2) = coming-to-be."
      - case: "The 'specious present' and experienced change"
        severity: "low"
        analysis: "Phenomenal experience of change = phenomenality + change. The 'feel' of change uses our existing primitives."
      - case: "Rate of change / acceleration"
        severity: "low"
        analysis: "Rate = quantity of change per time unit. Acceleration = change in rate. Composition of existing concepts."
    overall_severity: "low"
    notes: "All varieties of change (qualitative, relational, substantial, accelerated) expressible."

  cultural_variance:
    evidence_for_universality:
      - "All cultures have concepts of change and transformation"
      - "Language universally has tense systems"
      - "Change is basic to human experience"
    assessment: "universal"
    notes: "Universal concept, but derivable."

  parsimony:
    expressiveness_value: "high"
    necessary: false
    notes: "Change is conceptually central but built from succession, quality, and identity."

  verdict: "REJECT"
  confidence: 0.80
  reasoning_summary: "Heraclitean change - the fundamental flux of becoming - decomposes to identity + succession + quality + negation. The same entity has different properties at successive times. Process philosophy's 'becoming' is captured, not lost."
  key_insight: "Succession is more fundamental than change. Change is a pattern WITHIN succession (same thing, different qualities, successive times). The primitive is the ordering; the flux is derived."
