candidates:
  - label: "substance"
    domain: "being"
    proposed_symbol: "Σ"
    informal_definition: "The fundamental bearer of properties; that which exists independently and underlies all predication; Aristotle's primary category - the 'this' that has qualities but is not itself a quality."
    ostensive_examples:
      - "This particular horse (not 'horseness')"
      - "Socrates the individual (not humanity)"
      - "A lump of gold (not 'yellowness' or 'heaviness')"
      - "Descartes' res cogitans and res extensa"
    negative_examples:
      - "Properties or qualities (redness, heaviness)"
      - "Relations (taller than, next to)"
      - "Events (the explosion, the collision)"
      - "Abstract objects (numbers, propositions)"
    primitiveness_argument: "Aristotle placed substance as the primary category because everything else depends on it. Properties need bearers. Relations need relata. Without substance, there's nothing FOR qualities to qualify."
    decomposition_resistance: "Substance seems to resist analysis - it's the ultimate subject that can never become a predicate. How could the fundamental bearer of properties be defined in terms of properties?"
    relevance_to_gaps: "Tests whether Aristotelian metaphysics reduces to our alphabet. If substance is derivable, we've captured the core of Western ontology."

  - label: "change"
    domain: "time"
    proposed_symbol: "Δ"
    informal_definition: "The process of becoming different; transition from one state to another; the dynamic aspect of reality emphasized by Heraclitus ('everything flows') and process philosophy."
    ostensive_examples:
      - "Water heating up (temperature change)"
      - "A leaf turning from green to brown"
      - "Growing older"
      - "Learning something new"
    negative_examples:
      - "Static difference (A is different from B)"
      - "Mere succession (A then B, without A becoming B)"
      - "Spatial variation (red here, blue there)"
    primitiveness_argument: "Heraclitus and Whitehead argue change is more fundamental than static being. Perhaps succession only captures sequence, not the dynamic flux of becoming."
    decomposition_resistance: "Defining change as 'different states at different times' uses succession but loses the PROCESS - the 'becoming' rather than just 'being-at-t1 and being-at-t2'."
    relevance_to_gaps: "Tests whether process philosophy reduces to our alphabet. Critical for temporal completeness."

  - label: "unity"
    domain: "relation"
    proposed_symbol: "𝟙"
    informal_definition: "Oneness; the property of being a single, unified entity; the Neoplatonic 'One' beyond all multiplicity; the basis of numerical identity and individuation."
    ostensive_examples:
      - "A single organism vs a mere heap"
      - "One nation, one team, one idea"
      - "The number one as the basis of counting"
      - "Personal identity across time"
    negative_examples:
      - "Mere collection or aggregate"
      - "Division or multiplicity"
      - "Identity (being the same as itself - not the same as being ONE thing)"
    primitiveness_argument: "Plotinus placed the One above Being itself. Unity seems presupposed by identity (you must be ONE thing to be identical to yourself) and by quantity (one is the first number)."
    decomposition_resistance: "Can unity be decomposed? Identity says A=A, but unity says A is ONE thing. Quantity gives us 'how many' but presupposes countable units."
    relevance_to_gaps: "Tests whether Neoplatonic metaphysics reduces to our alphabet. Also tests numerical foundations."
