    attempts:
      - approach: "identity analysis"
        attempt: "Unity = being ONE thing = having identity"
        result: "If X=X (identity holds), then X is ONE thing. Unity is the flip side of identity - what has identity is ipso facto one."
        survived: false
      - approach: "numerical analysis"
        attempt: "One is the first number, basis of quantity"
        result: "One = the smallest positive quantity. Or: cardinality of a set with identity. Uses quantity + identity."
        survived: false
      - approach: "Neoplatonic One"
        attempt: "The One beyond Being (Plotinus) - maybe transcends our categories"
        result: "If the One is beyond being, it's either: (1) self-undermining (we're talking about it), or (2) expressible as possibility(negation(all-predicates)) - the meta-claim. Same analysis as transcendence."
        survived: false
      - approach: "heap vs organism"
        attempt: "Unity = what makes a whole more than its parts"
        result: "Organic unity = composition + some unifying quality (function, form). Expressible as composition + quality."
        survived: false
    survived: false
    notes: "Unity decomposes to identity + existence. To exist as one thing = to exist with self-identity. Neoplatonic One either transcends (same issue as transcendence) or reduces."

  circularity:
    concepts_traced: ["existence", "identity", "quantity", "composition"]
    survived: true
    notes: "Clean derivation - no circularity."

  redundancy:
    can_be_expressed: true
    using_primitives: ["existence", "identity"]
    derivation: "Unity(X) = ∃X ∧ (X=X). To be ONE thing = to exist and be self-identical. Plurality = composition of unities."
    notes: "FULLY REDUNDANT with identity. Unity is just identity viewed from the numerical angle."

  edge_cases:
    cases_found:
      - case: "Unity across time (personal identity)"
        severity: "low"
        analysis: "Same person over time = identity preserved through change. Uses identity + succession."
      - case: "Organic vs mechanical unity"
        severity: "low"
        analysis: "Organic: parts integrated by function. Mechanical: parts merely aggregated. Both use composition; organic adds normative/functional integration."
      - case: "The number one"
        severity: "low"
        analysis: "One = ∃!x (there exists exactly one x). Expressible with existence + identity + negation."
      - case: "Unity of consciousness"
        severity: "medium"
        analysis: "Unified phenomenal field = composition of phenomenal states into single experience. Uses phenomenality + composition."
    overall_severity: "low"
    notes: "All senses of unity reducible to identity + composition + other primitives."

  cultural_variance:
    evidence_for_universality:
      - "All cultures count and have concepts of 'one'"
      - "Unity/multiplicity distinction is universal"
      - "Individuation is basic to cognition"
    assessment: "universal"
    notes: "Universal but derived from more basic identity."

  parsimony:
    expressiveness_value: "medium"
    necessary: false
    notes: "Unity adds no expressive power beyond identity and composition."

  verdict: "REJECT"
  confidence: 0.85
  reasoning_summary: "Neoplatonic unity - the One beyond multiplicity - decomposes to identity + existence. To be one thing is to exist with self-identity. Plotinus' 'One beyond Being' faces the same issue as transcendence: either self-undermining or meta-expressible."
  key_insight: "Identity IS unity. Self-sameness (A=A) entails being ONE thing. The Neoplatonic tradition elevated unity to primacy, but identity is the more fundamental concept from which unity derives."
