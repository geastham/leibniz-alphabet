  decomposition:
    attempts:
      - approach: "existence-identity analysis"
        attempt: "Substance = that which EXISTS and has IDENTITY - the 'this' that persists"
        result: "A substance is simply an existent particular: ∃X where X has identity (X=X). This uses P001 + P002."
        survived: false
      - approach: "quality-bearer analysis"
        attempt: "Substance = the underlying bearer of properties"
        result: "Quality-bearing is built into how quality works - anything that exists can have qualities. No special 'bearer' primitive needed."
        survived: false
      - approach: "independence criterion"
        attempt: "Substance = that which exists independently, not in another"
        result: "Independence = existence + negation(composition-in-other). Derivable."
        survived: false
    survived: false
    notes: "Aristotle's substance decomposes to existence + identity. Primary substance = particular existent. Secondary substance = the quality/kind shared by particulars. No primitive needed."

  circularity:
    concepts_traced: ["existence", "identity", "quality"]
    survived: true
    notes: "Clean derivation - no circularity."

  redundancy:
    can_be_expressed: true
    using_primitives: ["existence", "identity", "quality"]
    derivation: "Substance(X) = ∃X ∧ (X=X) ∧ quality-bearer(X). Since anything that exists has identity and can bear qualities, substance = particular existent."
    notes: "FULLY REDUNDANT. Aristotle's primary category reduces to our primitives."

  edge_cases:
    cases_found:
      - case: "Bundle theory vs substratum"
        severity: "low"
        analysis: "Bundle theory: substance = bundle of qualities (composition of qualities). Substratum theory: bare particular + qualities. Both expressible with our primitives."
      - case: "Descartes' res cogitans and res extensa"
        severity: "low"
        analysis: "Mental substance = existent with phenomenality. Extended substance = existent with spatial properties. Both derivable."
      - case: "Events vs substances (process ontology)"
        severity: "low"
        analysis: "If events are fundamental (Whitehead), they're existents with temporal properties. Same framework applies."
    overall_severity: "low"
    notes: "All major theories of substance expressible within our framework."

  cultural_variance:
    evidence_for_universality:
      - "Substance concepts appear across cultures (Greek ousia, Sanskrit dravya)"
      - "Common sense distinguishes things from properties"
      - "Grammar has noun/predicate distinction"
    assessment: "universal"
    notes: "Universal concept, but derivable - not primitive."

  parsimony:
    expressiveness_value: "high"
    necessary: false
    notes: "Substance is central to Western metaphysics but derivable from more basic primitives."

  verdict: "REJECT"
  confidence: 0.85
  reasoning_summary: "Aristotle's substance - the fundamental bearer of properties, the 'this' underlying predication - decomposes to existence + identity. A substance is simply a particular existent. The alphabet captures Aristotelian metaphysics."
  key_insight: "The primacy of substance in Western metaphysics reflects conceptual importance, not irreducibility. Existence and identity are more fundamental than substance."
