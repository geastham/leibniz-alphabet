  label: normativity
  domain: ethics
  symbol: "\u22A8"
  prime_number: 31
  definition:
    informal: The dimension of ought, should, must; that some things are correct,
      proper, or required while others are incorrect, improper, or forbidden. Normativity
      is orthogonal to description - it captures what SHOULD BE, not what IS.
    formal: null
  examples:
    ostensive:
    - You OUGHT to keep your promises
    - 2+2 SHOULD equal 4 (epistemic normativity)
    - This move is CORRECT in chess
    negative:
    - Normativity is not regularity - things fall, but don't OUGHT to fall
    - Normativity is not preference - preferences aren't correctness

  notes: Eleventh primitive. Opens the evaluative dimension. The is/ought gap is real
    - descriptive primitives cannot generate normativity. With normativity, we can
    derive valence (quality + normative status).
