role: PROPOSER
iteration: 5
candidates:
- label: normativity
  domain: ethics
  proposed_symbol: "\u22A8"
  informal_definition: The dimension of ought/should/must; that some things are correct
    or required while others are incorrect or forbidden.
  ostensive_examples:
  - You OUGHT to keep your promises
  - 2+2 SHOULD equal 4 (epistemic normativity)
  - This move is CORRECT in chess
  negative_examples:
  - Normativity is not regularity - things fall, but don't OUGHT to fall
  - Normativity is not preference - I prefer chocolate, but it isn't CORRECT
  primitiveness_argument: '''Should'', ''ought'', ''correct'', ''required'' ARE normativity.
    The is/ought gap suggests non-derivability from descriptive facts.'
  decomposition_resistance: Naturalistic reductions face open question argument. 'X
    maximizes happiness' doesn't MEAN 'X is good'.
  relevance_to_gaps: Cannot express obligations or values without normativity.

- label: truth
  domain: knowledge
  proposed_symbol: T
  informal_definition: The correspondence between representation and reality; what
    makes beliefs accurate and statements correct.
  ostensive_examples:
  - It is TRUE that snow is white
  - Her belief is TRUE - things are as she thinks
  - The map is TRUE to the territory
  negative_examples:
  - Truth is not belief - false beliefs exist
  - Truth is not usefulness - useful falsehoods exist
  primitiveness_argument: '''Corresponds to reality'', ''accurate'' - ''corresponds''
    may just BE truth. Deeply contested.'
  decomposition_resistance: Deflationism shows truth is so basic it's transparent.
    All theories presuppose what they define.
  relevance_to_gaps: Intentionality gives aboutness, truth gives CORRECTNESS of aboutness.

- label: valence
  domain: emotion
  proposed_symbol: "\xB1"
  informal_definition: The positive-negative dimension of experience; that some experiences
    feel good while others feel bad.
  ostensive_examples:
  - This pleasure has POSITIVE valence
  - This pain has NEGATIVE valence
  - Boredom has mildly negative valence
  negative_examples:
  - Valence is not intensity - mild and intense pleasure have same valence
  - Valence is not preference - might prefer negative valence (challenging exercise)
  primitiveness_argument: '''Feels good/bad'', ''pleasant/unpleasant'' ARE valence.
    Felt positivity/negativity seems irreducible.'
  decomposition_resistance: Reducing to approach/avoidance misses phenomenal quality.
    We approach BECAUSE it feels good.
  relevance_to_gaps: Quality gives WHAT KIND of experience, valence gives HOW IT FEELS
    evaluatively.
