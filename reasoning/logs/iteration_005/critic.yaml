role: CRITIC
evaluations:
- candidate_label: normativity
  decomposition:
    attempts:
    - approach: analytic
      attempt: Define as what rationality requires
      result: Circular - 'requires' is normative.
      survived: true
    - approach: synthetic
      attempt: Break into goals + means (hypothetical imperatives)
      result: Partial - misses categorical normativity.
      survived: true
    - approach: functional
      attempt: Define as what evolution selects for
      result: Naturalistic fallacy - IS doesn't imply OUGHT.
      survived: true
    survived: true
    notes: Is/ought gap holds. Normativity resists reduction.
  circularity:
    concepts_traced:
    - ought
    - should
    - must
    - correct
    - right
    - required
    circular_paths: []
    survived: true
    notes: All ARE normativity. Normative circle unbreakable.
  redundancy:
    can_be_expressed: false
    using_primitives:
    - existence
    - identity
    - negation
    - succession
    - possibility
    - adjacency
    - intentionality
    - quality
    - quantity
    - composition
    notes: All primitives descriptive. Cannot capture OUGHT dimension.
  edge_cases:
    cases_found:
    - case: Moral relativism
      severity: high
    - case: Types of normativity
      severity: medium
    overall_severity: high
    notes: Structure of normativity universal even if norms vary.
  cultural_variance:
    evidence_for_universality:
    - All cultures have right/wrong concepts
    - All languages have deontic modals
    evidence_against:
    - Moral norms vary
    assessment: mostly universal
    notes: Normative structure universal.
  parsimony:
    expressiveness_value: high
    necessary: true
    notes: Without normativity, cannot express ethics or evaluative judgments.
  verdict: ACCEPT
  confidence: 0.78
  reasoning_summary: Normativity survives. Is/ought gap real. Need it for SHOULD dimension.
  key_insight: Normativity orthogonal to all descriptive primitives. The evaluative
    dimension.

- candidate_label: truth
  decomposition:
    attempts:
    - approach: analytic
      attempt: Define as correspondence with facts
      result: Circular - facts are true states of affairs.
      survived: true
    - approach: synthetic
      attempt: Break into intentionality + existence of object
      result: PROMISING - truth = intentional object exists.
      survived: false
    - approach: functional
      attempt: Define as what inquiry converges on
      result: Circular - inquiry aims at truth.
      survived: true
    survived: false
    notes: Truth = existence of intentional object. Derivable!
  circularity:
    concepts_traced:
    - corresponds
    - accurate
    - fact
    - reality
    circular_paths:
    - "truth \u2192 fact \u2192 true state \u2192 truth"
    survived: true
    notes: Ordinary circular, but intentionality + existence escapes.
  redundancy:
    can_be_expressed: true
    using_primitives:
    - intentionality
    - existence
    notes: TRUTH = intentional object EXISTS. Representation true iff what it represents
      is real.
  edge_cases:
    cases_found:
    - case: Negative truths
      severity: medium
    - case: Abstract truths
      severity: medium
    overall_severity: medium
    notes: Handleable. Negative truths = non-existence.
  cultural_variance:
    evidence_for_universality:
    - All cultures distinguish true from false
    evidence_against: []
    assessment: universal
    notes: Truth concept universal.
  parsimony:
    expressiveness_value: high
    necessary: false
    notes: Truth derivable from intentionality + existence.
  verdict: REJECT
  confidence: 0.68
  reasoning_summary: Truth = intentionality + existence. Another productive rejection.
  key_insight: Shows power of existing primitives. Truth derivable!
  candidate_id: CAND_005_01
- candidate_label: valence
  decomposition:
    attempts:
    - approach: analytic
      attempt: Define as approach/avoidance
      result: Fails - we approach BECAUSE of valence, not identical.
      survived: true
    - approach: synthetic
      attempt: Break into quality + normativity
      result: INTERESTING - valence = quality with normative polarity.
      survived: false
    - approach: functional
      attempt: Define as motivational direction
      result: Same problem - motivation tracks but isn't valence.
      survived: true
    survived: false
    notes: Valence = quality + normativity. Quality with normative status.
  circularity:
    concepts_traced:
    - good feeling
    - pleasant
    - positive affect
    circular_paths: []
    survived: true
    notes: Quality + normativity may escape circle.
  redundancy:
    can_be_expressed: true
    using_primitives:
    - quality
    - normativity
    notes: Pleasure = quality that OUGHT to be pursued. Pain = quality that OUGHT
      to be avoided.
  edge_cases:
    cases_found:
    - case: Masochism
      severity: medium
    overall_severity: medium
    notes: Complex quality structure, not counterexample.
  cultural_variance:
    evidence_for_universality:
    - All humans experience pleasure/pain
    evidence_against: []
    assessment: universal
    notes: Hedonic dimension universal.
  parsimony:
    expressiveness_value: high
    necessary: false
    notes: Derivable IF normativity accepted.
  verdict: REJECT
  confidence: 0.65
  reasoning_summary: Valence = quality + normativity. Pleasure is normatively positive
    quality.
  key_insight: Depends on accepting normativity. Shows normativity's expressive power.
