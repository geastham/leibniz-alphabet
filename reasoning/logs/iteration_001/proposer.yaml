role: PROPOSER
iteration: 1
candidates:
- label: negation
  domain: relation
  proposed_symbol: "\xAC"
  informal_definition: The logical operation that reverses truth value; the concept
    of NOT. When applied to any proposition or concept, it yields its opposite or
    denial.
  ostensive_examples:
  - It is NOT raining (the denial of 'it is raining')
  - This is not-red (the absence of redness)
  - Non-existence (the negation of existence)
  negative_examples:
  - Negation is not mere absence - empty space is not negation
  - Negation is not opposition - hot vs cold are opposites but neither IS negation
  - Negation is not falsity - false propositions presuppose negation
  primitiveness_argument: To define negation, you must say what it is NOT - but that
    uses negation. Every attempt to explain 'not' uses 'not' or synonyms.
  decomposition_resistance: Try defining NOT without using not, non-, un-, lack, absence,
    denial - you cannot. All these ARE negation.
  relevance_to_gaps: 'Critical gap from iteration 0: difference = negation(identity).
    Without negation, we cannot express difference, absence, or falsity.'
  confidence: 0.95

- label: causation
  domain: causation
  proposed_symbol: "\u2192c"
  informal_definition: The relation whereby one event brings about another. The 'because'
    relation - why things happen.
  ostensive_examples:
  - The rock broke the window (impact caused breaking)
  - Heat causes water to boil
  - Her decision caused the outcome
  negative_examples:
  - Correlation is not causation
  - Temporal succession is not causation - night follows day but day doesn't cause
    night
  primitiveness_argument: 'Every attempt to define causation uses causal language:
    ''produces'', ''brings about'', ''makes happen''. Even Hume''s reductive account
    smuggles in causation.'
  decomposition_resistance: Regularity theories, counterfactual theories, process
    theories - all either presuppose causation or fail to capture it.
  relevance_to_gaps: Without causation, we cannot express 'why' anything happens.
  confidence: 0.8
  id: CAND_001_01
- label: succession
  domain: time
  proposed_symbol: "\u227A"
  informal_definition: The temporal relation of one moment coming after another; the
    before/after relation that structures time.
  ostensive_examples:
  - Monday comes before Tuesday
  - The flash preceded the thunder
  - Birth precedes death
  negative_examples:
  - Succession is not causation - before doesn't imply because
  - Succession is not spatial ordering
  - Succession is not duration
  primitiveness_argument: To define 'before' you say 'earlier than' or 'prior to'
    - but these ARE succession. You cannot explain temporal order without using temporal
    order.
  decomposition_resistance: Attempts to reduce time to causation or space don't eliminate
    succession - they relocate it.
  relevance_to_gaps: Without succession, we cannot express change, process, or any
    temporal fact.
