  definition:
    informal: The temporal relation of one moment or event coming after another; the
      before/after relation that structures time as an ordered sequence. Succession
      is the skeleton of time itself.
    formal: null
  examples:
    ostensive:
    - Monday comes before Tuesday
    - The flash preceded the thunder
    - Birth precedes death
    negative:
    - Succession is not causation - before doesn't imply because
    - Succession is not spatial ordering
    - Succession is not duration

  notes: 'Fourth primitive. Opens the temporal dimension. Now we can express change:
    something exists, then something different exists.'
