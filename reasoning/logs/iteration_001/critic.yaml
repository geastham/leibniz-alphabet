role: CRITIC
evaluations:
- candidate_label: negation
  decomposition:
    attempts:
    - approach: analytic
      attempt: Define as truth-value reversal
      result: Circular - 'false' IS negation of true.
      survived: true
    - approach: synthetic
      attempt: Break into absence + opposition
      result: Fails - both presuppose negation.
      survived: true
    - approach: functional
      attempt: Define as what NOT does
      result: Just ostension, not decomposition.
      survived: true
    survived: true
    notes: Every attempt uses NOT or synonyms. True primitive.
  circularity:
    concepts_traced:
    - not
    - denial
    - absence
    - lack
    - without
    circular_paths: []
    survived: true
    notes: All traced concepts ARE negation. Acceptable.
  redundancy:
    can_be_expressed: false
    using_primitives:
    - existence
    - identity
    notes: Cannot say 'not-X' using only existence and identity.
  edge_cases:
    cases_found:
    - case: Double negation
      severity: low
    overall_severity: low
    notes: Edge cases concern logic OF negation, not the concept.
  cultural_variance:
    evidence_for_universality:
    - All languages have negation markers
    - Infants understand 'no' early
    evidence_against: []
    assessment: universal
    notes: Most universal logical concept.
  parsimony:
    expressiveness_value: essential
    necessary: true
    notes: Unlocks difference, non-existence, falsity, absence.
  verdict: ACCEPT
  confidence: 0.95
  reasoning_summary: Negation is demonstrably primitive. Every definition circular.
    Essential for logical expressiveness.
  key_insight: 'Completes basic toolkit: existence (IS), identity (ITSELF), negation
    (NOT).'

- candidate_label: causation
  decomposition:
    attempts:
    - approach: analytic
      attempt: Define as regular succession (Hume)
      result: Partial success but 'regular' is causal.
      survived: false
    - approach: synthetic
      attempt: Break into temporal priority + counterfactual dependence
      result: Promising - may reduce to succession + negation + modality.
      survived: false
    - approach: functional
      attempt: Define as physical quantity transmission
      result: '''Transmits'' is causal language.'
      survived: true
    survived: false
    notes: Counterfactual analysis may succeed. Causation might not be primitive.
  circularity:
    concepts_traced:
    - produces
    - brings about
    - because
    circular_paths:
    - "causation \u2192 produces \u2192 causation"
    survived: true
    notes: Ordinary definitions circular, but counterfactual avoids this.
  redundancy:
    can_be_expressed: true
    using_primitives:
    - succession
    - negation
    - MODALITY
    notes: "C causes E \u2261 C \u227A E \u2227 \u25A1(\xACC \u2192 \xACE). Needs\
      \ modality, not causation."
  edge_cases:
    cases_found:
    - case: Overdetermination
      severity: medium
    - case: Preemption
      severity: high
    overall_severity: high
    notes: Severe edge cases challenge all analyses.
  cultural_variance:
    evidence_for_universality:
    - All cultures recognize causal relations
    evidence_against: []
    assessment: universal
    notes: Universal but not primitive.
  parsimony:
    expressiveness_value: high
    necessary: false
    notes: Should add MODALITY as primitive instead.
  verdict: REJECT
  confidence: 0.7
  reasoning_summary: Causation may reduce to succession + negation + modality. Propose
    MODALITY instead.
  key_insight: Reveals MODALITY as likely primitive.

- candidate_label: succession
  decomposition:
    attempts:
    - approach: analytic
      attempt: Define as causal ordering
      result: Fails - causation presupposes time, not vice versa.
      survived: true
    - approach: synthetic
      attempt: Break into moments + ordering
      result: Just renaming succession.
      survived: true
    - approach: functional
      attempt: Define as what clocks measure
      result: Circular - clocks work BY tracking succession.
      survived: true
    survived: true
    notes: Before/after relation resists elimination.
  circularity:
    concepts_traced:
    - before
    - after
    - earlier
    - later
    - prior
    circular_paths: []
    survived: true
    notes: All ARE succession. Acceptable primitive circularity.
  redundancy:
    can_be_expressed: false
    using_primitives:
    - existence
    - identity
    - negation
    notes: Current alphabet lacks temporal dimension.
  edge_cases:
    cases_found:
    - case: Relativity - observer-relative?
      severity: medium
    - case: Simultaneous events
      severity: low
    overall_severity: medium
    notes: Challenge theory of time, not primitiveness.
  cultural_variance:
    evidence_for_universality:
    - All languages have temporal markers
    - Narrative structure universal
    evidence_against: []
    assessment: universal
    notes: Fundamental to human cognition.
  parsimony:
    expressiveness_value: essential
    necessary: true
    notes: Opens temporal dimension. Enables expressing change.
  verdict: ACCEPT
  confidence: 0.88
  reasoning_summary: Succession survives all attacks. Irreducible, universal, essential
    for time.
  key_insight: 'With existence, identity, negation, succession: change becomes expressible.'
