    attempts:
      - approach: "negation-of-succession"
        attempt: "Simultaneity = negation(succession) in both directions"
        result: "Two events A,B are simultaneous iff ¬(A≺B) ∧ ¬(B≺A) - mutual non-precedence"
        survived: false
      - approach: "co-existence-in-time"
        attempt: "Simultaneity = existence(A) + existence(B) + shared temporal moment"
        result: "Shared temporal moment = neither precedes the other = back to negation(succession)"
        survived: false
      - approach: "relativistic"
        attempt: "Simultaneity is frame-dependent in physics - maybe needs its own primitive"
        result: "Frame-dependence is a physical fact about simultaneity, not the concept itself. The concept remains derivable."
        survived: false
    survived: false
    notes: "Simultaneity fully decomposes to: co-existence + mutual non-succession. A ∥ B = ∃A ∧ ∃B ∧ ¬(A≺B) ∧ ¬(B≺A)"

  circularity:
    concepts_traced: ["existence", "negation", "succession"]
    survived: true
    notes: "Clean derivation using only existing primitives."

  redundancy:
    can_be_expressed: true
    using_primitives: ["existence", "negation", "succession"]
    derivation: "Simultaneity(A,B) = ∃A ∧ ∃B ∧ ¬(A≺B) ∧ ¬(B≺A)"
    notes: "FULLY DERIVABLE from existence, negation, and succession."

  edge_cases:
    cases_found:
      - case: "Relativistic simultaneity (frame-dependent)"
        severity: "low"
        analysis: "That simultaneity is relative doesn't make it primitive. The CONCEPT is still derivable. Physics adds that the answer varies by reference frame."
      - case: "Instantaneous vs. extended events"
        severity: "low"
        analysis: "Extended events that overlap are 'simultaneous' in the overlap. This uses composition + succession."
      - case: "Atemporal entities (numbers, abstract objects)"
        severity: "low"
        analysis: "Non-temporal things aren't in succession relations - simultaneity doesn't apply. This is appropriate."
    overall_severity: "low"
    notes: "All edge cases handled by the derivation."

  cultural_variance:
    evidence_for_universality:
      - "All cultures have concepts of 'at the same time'"
      - "Coordination requires simultaneity concept"
      - "Music, dance, ritual all involve synchrony"
    assessment: "universal"
    notes: "Universal concept, but derivable - not primitive."

  parsimony:
    expressiveness_value: "medium"
    necessary: false
    notes: "Simultaneity adds no new expressive power beyond what succession + negation provide."

  verdict: "REJECT"
  confidence: 0.85
  reasoning_summary: "Simultaneity is fully derivable as mutual non-succession of co-existing events. The formula A ∥ B = ∃A ∧ ∃B ∧ ¬(A≺B) ∧ ¬(B≺A) captures the concept using only existence, negation, and succession."
  key_insight: "Temporal relations are COMPLETE with succession alone. Before, after, and at-the-same-time all reduce to succession + negation. The single temporal primitive suffices."
