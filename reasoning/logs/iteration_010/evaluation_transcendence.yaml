  candidate_label: "transcendence"
  decomposition:
    attempts:
      - approach: "negation-of-limits"
        attempt: "Transcendence = that which exceeds all limits = negation(bounded)"
        result: "We derived infinity as negation(existence(maximum)). Transcendence follows the same pattern for categories."
        survived: false
      - approach: "self-undermining-analysis"
        attempt: "If we name transcendence, haven't we categorized the uncategorizable?"
        result: "Yes - the concept is self-undermining. Saying 'X transcends all categories' places X in the category of 'transcendent things'."
        survived: false
      - approach: "meta-level-claim"
        attempt: "Transcendence = the claim that possibly something exists that escapes expression"
        result: "Derivable as: ◇(∃X ∧ ¬expressible(X)). This is a meta-level claim ABOUT the alphabet, expressible within it."
        survived: false
      - approach: "mystical-ineffable"
        attempt: "The mystical shows itself but cannot be said (Wittgenstein)"
        result: "This is ABOUT the limits of language, not a primitive concept. The alphabet can express 'there are limits to expression' without needing a primitive for what lies beyond."
        survived: false
    survived: false
    notes: "Transcendence is either self-undermining or reduces to a meta-level claim expressible with possibility + negation."

  circularity:
    concepts_traced: ["existence", "negation", "possibility", "category/quality"]
    survived: true
    notes: "No circularity - but the concept dissolves under analysis rather than decomposing."

  redundancy:
    can_be_expressed: true
    using_primitives: ["possibility", "existence", "negation"]
    derivation: "Transcendence = The meta-claim ◇∃X(∀P.¬P(X)) - possibly something exists that no predicate captures. This is expressible."
    notes: "The IDEA of transcendence is expressible. Whether transcendent things EXIST is a separate question the alphabet can formulate."

  edge_cases:
    cases_found:
      - case: "Kant's noumena"
        severity: "medium"
        analysis: "Things-in-themselves beyond phenomena. But 'beyond phenomena' = negation(phenomenality-applies). Expressible."
      - case: "Apophatic theology - God beyond being"
        severity: "medium"
        analysis: "Defining God by what God is not. Uses negation systematically. The VIA NEGATIVA is a method, not a primitive."
      - case: "Gödel's incompleteness"
        severity: "low"
        analysis: "Some truths unprovable in a system. This is about formal systems, not about what concepts are primitive."
      - case: "The alphabet's own limits"
        severity: "medium"
        analysis: "Can the alphabet express its own incompleteness? Yes: ◇∃X(¬expressible(X)). Self-reference applies here."
    overall_severity: "medium"
    notes: "Edge cases point to LIMITS of expression, but the alphabet can express that limits exist."

  cultural_variance:
    evidence_for_universality:
      - "Mystical traditions exist globally"
      - "Apophatic approaches appear in many religions"
      - "Mathematical infinity is culturally widespread"
    assessment: "widespread but not universal"
    notes: "Not all cultures emphasize transcendence; some are more immanent-focused. This suggests it may be a culturally-shaped concept."

  parsimony:
    expressiveness_value: "low"
    necessary: false
    notes: "Adding transcendence would either be self-undermining or redundant. Either way, it fails parsimony."

  verdict: "REJECT"
  confidence: 0.75
  reasoning_summary: "Transcendence fails verification. Either: (1) it's self-undermining because naming the uncategorizable categorizes it, or (2) it reduces to the meta-level claim that possibly something exists beyond expression - a claim expressible using possibility, existence, and negation. The alphabet can formulate the QUESTION of its own limits without needing a primitive for what lies beyond."
  key_insight: "The alphabet is SELF-AWARE of its limits. It can express 'possibly there exist things I cannot express' without needing a primitive called 'transcendence'. The boundary of the sayable is itself sayable as a boundary."
