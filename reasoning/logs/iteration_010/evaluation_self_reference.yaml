evaluation:
  candidate_label: "self-reference"
  decomposition:
    attempts:
      - approach: "intentionality-based"
        attempt: "Self-reference = intentionality directed at the bearer of that intentionality"
        result: "This is exactly REFLEXIVITY, derived in iteration 7: →m(bearer-of-☉)"
        survived: false
      - approach: "identity-based"
        attempt: "Self-reference = identity applied reflexively in thought"
        result: "Collapses to intentionality(identity(self)) - uses existing primitives"
        survived: false
    survived: false
    notes: "Self-reference was already derived as REFLEXIVITY in iteration 7. The loop structure of self-reference IS intentionality taking its own bearer as object."

  circularity:
    concepts_traced: ["intentionality", "phenomenality", "identity"]
    survived: true
    notes: "No circularity in the decomposition - we define self-reference in terms of simpler primitives."

  redundancy:
    can_be_expressed: true
    using_primitives: ["intentionality", "phenomenality", "identity"]
    derivation: "Self-reference = →m(bearer-of-☉) where bearer-of-☉ is the self identified via phenomenality"
    notes: "FULLY REDUNDANT with existing derived concept REFLEXIVITY from iteration 7."

  edge_cases:
    cases_found:
      - case: "Liar paradox 'this sentence is false'"
        severity: "low"
        analysis: "Expressible as: assertion that refers to itself + negation. The PARADOX arises from self-reference + negation, both of which we have."
      - case: "Russell's paradox"
        severity: "low"
        analysis: "The set of all non-self-containing sets = composition(negation(self-membership)). Self-membership = self-reference applied to composition."
      - case: "Gödel sentences"
        severity: "low"
        analysis: "Statements encoding their own unprovability = self-reference + negation(provability). Provability is a meta-level concept about formal systems."
    overall_severity: "low"
    notes: "All paradoxes expressible using self-reference, which is derivable. The POWER of self-reference comes from combining it with negation."

  cultural_variance:
    evidence_for_universality:
      - "Self-awareness is universal in humans"
      - "Reflexive pronouns exist in all languages"
      - "Recursive thought appears universal"
    assessment: "universal"
    notes: "Self-reference is culturally universal, but that doesn't make it primitive - universality doesn't imply primitiveness."

  parsimony:
    expressiveness_value: "high"
    necessary: false
    notes: "Self-reference is expressively powerful but ALREADY DERIVABLE. Adding it as primitive would violate parsimony."

  verdict: "REJECT"
  confidence: 0.90
  reasoning_summary: "Self-reference was already derived as REFLEXIVITY in iteration 7. It decomposes to intentionality directed at the bearer of phenomenality. The paradox-generating power comes from COMBINING self-reference with negation - both already available."
  key_insight: "The alphabet already contains self-reference as a derived concept. Paradoxes arise from self-reference PLUS negation - composition of existing concepts."
