- candidate_label: adjacency
  decomposition:
    attempts:
    - approach: analytic
      attempt: Define as zero distance between boundaries
      result: Circular - distance is constructed FROM adjacency.
      survived: true
    - approach: synthetic
      attempt: Break into distinctness + no space between
      result: '''No space between'' IS adjacency.'
      survived: true
    - approach: functional
      attempt: Define as potential for direct causal interaction
      result: Conflates space and causation. Quantum entanglement refutes.
      survived: true
    survived: true
    notes: Adjacency resists decomposition. Spatial contact is irreducible.
  circularity:
    concepts_traced:
    - touching
    - next to
    - bordering
    - contiguous
    circular_paths: []
    survived: true
    notes: All traced concepts ARE adjacency. Signature of primitive.
  redundancy:
    can_be_expressed: false
    using_primitives:
    - existence
    - identity
    - negation
    - succession
    - possibility
    notes: No spatial concepts in alphabet. Cannot build from non-spatial.
  edge_cases:
    cases_found:
    - case: Quantum superposition of adjacency
      severity: medium
    overall_severity: medium
    notes: Edge cases concern physics, not concept itself.
  cultural_variance:
    evidence_for_universality:
    - All languages distinguish next-to from far-from
    - Spatial reasoning cognitively fundamental
    evidence_against: []
    assessment: universal
    notes: Spatial proximity is cognitive universal.
  parsimony:
    expressiveness_value: essential
    necessary: true
    notes: Location and distance derivable from adjacency. It's the spatial primitive.
  verdict: ACCEPT
  confidence: 0.88
  reasoning_summary: Adjacency is irreducible spatial relation. Fills spatial gap.
  key_insight: Adjacency is to space what succession is to time - basic ordering relation.

- candidate_label: intentionality
  decomposition:
    attempts:
    - approach: analytic
      attempt: Define as causal covariation with objects
      result: Fails - thoughts about unicorns don't covary with unicorns.
      survived: true
    - approach: synthetic
      attempt: Break into mental state + object of thought
      result: Describes but doesn't decompose. The OF relation IS intentionality.
      survived: true
    - approach: functional
      attempt: Define as what gives semantic content
      result: Circular - semantic content IS intentionality.
      survived: true
    survived: true
    notes: Intentionality resists naturalistic reduction. Aboutness is sui generis.
  circularity:
    concepts_traced:
    - about
    - of
    - directed at
    - representing
    - meaning

    notes: All ARE intentionality. Brentano was right.

    - case: Non-existent objects of thought
      severity: medium
    - case: Derived intentionality of words
      severity: medium
    overall_severity: medium
    notes: Edge cases concern extension, not primitiveness.
  cultural_variance:
    evidence_for_universality:
    - All cultures recognize thoughts are about things
    - Belief/desire psychology cross-cultural
    evidence_against: []
    assessment: universal
    notes: Intentionality is universal structure of mental life.
  parsimony:
    expressiveness_value: essential
    necessary: true
    notes: Opens mental dimension. Required for belief, desire, meaning.
  verdict: ACCEPT
  confidence: 0.85
  reasoning_summary: Intentionality is irreducible aboutness. Fills mental gap.
  key_insight: Intentionality is to mind what adjacency is to space - constitutive
    relation.

- candidate_label: quality
  decomposition:
    attempts:
    - approach: analytic
      attempt: Define as determinable property
      result: Informative but doesn't decompose. Property IS quality.
      survived: true
    - approach: synthetic
      attempt: Break into thing + way of being
      result: '''Way of being'' IS quality.'
      survived: true
    - approach: functional
      attempt: Define as what makes things similar in respects
      result: Presupposes quality - respects ARE qualities.
      survived: true
    survived: true
    notes: Quality resists decomposition. Intrinsic character is primitive.
  circularity:
    concepts_traced:
    - property
    - attribute
    - characteristic

    circular_paths: []
    survived: true
    notes: All ARE quality. Concept is primitive.

    using_primitives:
    - existence
    - identity
    - negation
    - succession
    - possibility
    notes: Quality adds WHAT things are like. Existence says THAT, quality says WHAT
      KIND.
  edge_cases:
    cases_found:
    - case: Are relations qualities?
      severity: medium
    - case: Structural vs qualitative properties
      severity: low
    overall_severity: medium
    notes: Edge cases concern boundaries. Core concept clear.
  cultural_variance:
    evidence_for_universality:
    - All languages have quality words
    - Thing/property distinction universal
    evidence_against: []
    assessment: universal
    notes: Quality/substance distinction appears in all cultures.
  parsimony:
    expressiveness_value: high
    necessary: true
    notes: Without quality, cannot express what things are LIKE.
  verdict: ACCEPT
  confidence: 0.82
  reasoning_summary: Quality is primitive intrinsic character. What things are like.
  key_insight: Existence=THAT, identity=WHICH, quality=WHAT KIND. Orthogonal dimensions.
