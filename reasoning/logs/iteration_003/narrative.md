# Iteration 3: The Great Expansion

**Date**: 2026-01-18
**Phase**: EXPANSION
**Strategy**: REFINEMENT + DOMAIN_SWEEP
**Reasoning Engine**: Claude Session (interactive)

## Summary

Iteration 3 marks the most productive iteration yet - all three candidates accepted! The refinement suggestions from iteration 2 proved fruitful, and we opened three new dimensions: space, mind, and quality.

**Results**:
- **Candidates Proposed**: 3 (adjacency, intentionality, quality)
- **Candidates Accepted**: 3 (ALL!)
- **Acceptance Rate**: 100%
- **Total Primitives**: 8

## The Candidates

### 1. ADJACENCY (ACCEPTED)

Refined from the rejected "location" candidate, the PROPOSER suggested **adjacency** - the basic spatial relation of being next to.

The CRITIC found it irreducible:
- **Decomposition**: "Zero distance" presupposes adjacency. Distance is BUILT from adjacency chains.
- **Distinctiveness**: Adjacency is to space what succession is to time - the basic ordering relation.

**Verdict**: ACCEPT with 0.88 confidence

**Key Insight**: Location and distance can be DERIVED from adjacency. Location = pattern of adjacencies to reference objects. Distance = length of shortest adjacency chain.

### 2. INTENTIONALITY (ACCEPTED)

Refined from the rejected "awareness" candidate, the PROPOSER suggested **intentionality** - the aboutness of mental states.

The CRITIC confirmed its primitiveness:
- **Decomposition**: Naturalistic reductions fail. The "aboutness" relation is sui generis.
- **Distinctiveness**: Brentano was right - intentionality is the mark of the mental.

**Verdict**: ACCEPT with 0.85 confidence

**Key Insight**: Intentionality is more fundamental than awareness. Blindsight shows intentionality without full awareness. We can now express mental facts: "There is a thought ABOUT X."

### 3. QUALITY (ACCEPTED)

The PROPOSER suggested **quality** - the intrinsic character of things.

The CRITIC found it irreducible:
- **Decomposition**: "Property", "attribute", "way of being" ARE quality.
- **Distinctiveness**: Quality is orthogonal to our other primitives. Existence = THAT, identity = WHICH, quality = WHAT KIND.

**Verdict**: ACCEPT with 0.82 confidence

**Key Insight**: Without quality, we could say things exist, are identical, are in space/time, are possible, are thought about - but not that they are RED or HOT or LOUD. Quality captures the intrinsic character.

| ID | Label | Domain | Symbol | Prime | Added |
|----|-------|--------|--------|-------|-------|
| P001 | existence | being | ∃ | 2 | iter 0 |

| P008 | quality | quality | Q | 19 | iter 3 |

## Expressive Power Analysis

With 8 primitives, we can now express:

### Spatial facts (NEW):
- **Adjacency**: x ⊣ y (x is next to y)
- **Location**: pattern of adjacencies to reference points
- **Distance**: length of adjacency chains
- **Spatial change**: x ⊣ y, then x ⊣ z (movement)

### Mental facts (NEW):
- **Thought**: →m(mind, object) - a mental state directed at an object
- **Belief**: →m(mind, proposition) where proposition possibly true
- **Desire**: →m(mind, state) where state not yet actual

### Qualitative facts (NEW):
- **Quality**: Q(thing, determinable, determinate) - thing has quality Q with value V
- **Similarity**: same quality value
- **Change in quality**: Q(x, color, red) then Q(x, color, blue)

## Dimensions Covered

| Dimension | Primitive | What it captures |
|-----------|-----------|------------------|
| Being | existence | THAT things are |
| Identity | identity | WHICH thing |
| Logic | negation | What is NOT |
| Time | succession | WHEN (ordering) |
| Modality | possibility | What COULD BE |
| Space | adjacency | WHERE (ordering) |
| Mind | intentionality | ABOUT what |
| Quality | quality | WHAT KIND |

## Prime Number Calculus

The Leibnizian dream advances. With 8 primes:

| Prime | Primitive |
|-------|-----------|
| 2 | existence |
| 3 | identity |
| 5 | negation |
| 7 | succession |
| 11 | possibility |
| 13 | adjacency |
| 17 | intentionality |
| 19 | quality |

Complex concepts as products:
- **Spatial existence**: 2 × 13 = 26
- **Temporal possibility**: 7 × 11 = 77
- **Mental quality** (qualia!): 17 × 19 = 323
- **Change**: 2 × 5 × 7 = 70 (existence, then non-existence, ordered by succession)

## Domains Coverage

| Domain | Primitives | Status |
|--------|------------|--------|
| Being | 2 | ✓ Complete |
| Relation | 2 | ✓ Complete |
| Time | 1 | ✓ Basic |
| Space | 1 | ✓ Basic |
| Mind | 1 | ✓ Basic |
| Quality | 1 | ✓ Basic |
| Quantity | 0 | **Needs attention** |
| Action | 0 | **Needs attention** |
| Causation | 0 | Derivable |

## Reflections

### What's Working
- Refinement process is effective (location → adjacency, awareness → intentionality)
- The "ordering relation" pattern (succession for time, adjacency for space) is powerful
- Each new primitive opens a genuine new dimension

### What's Missing
- **Quantity**: We can say WHAT KIND but not HOW MUCH
- **Action/Agency**: We can describe states but not doings
- **Composition**: How do parts relate to wholes?

### Next Steps
1. Propose QUANTITY as the "how much" dimension
2. Consider ACTION or AGENCY for the doing dimension
3. After 4 iterations, META-REFLECTION is due

## Philosophical Reflection

Eight primitives now span eight fundamental dimensions of thought:
- **Ontological**: existence, identity
- **Logical**: negation
- **Temporal**: succession
- **Modal**: possibility
- **Spatial**: adjacency
- **Mental**: intentionality
- **Qualitative**: quality

This is a remarkably compact basis. Leibniz would be pleased - we have something approaching his "alphabet of human thought" with just 8 irreducible concepts.

The remaining gaps (quantity, action) are clear targets. But we may be approaching diminishing returns - most concepts can likely be COMPOSED from what we have.
