candidates:
- label: adjacency
  domain: space
  proposed_symbol: "\u22A3"
  informal_definition: The basic spatial relation of being next to or touching; immediate
    spatial proximity without intervening space.
  ostensive_examples:
  - This brick is adjacent to that brick (touching)
  - France is adjacent to Germany (sharing a border)
  - The electron is adjacent to the nucleus
  negative_examples:
  - Adjacency is not identity - adjacent things are distinct
  - Adjacency is not overlap - adjacent things touch but don't interpenetrate
  primitiveness_argument: To define adjacency, we say 'touching', 'next to', 'bordering'
    - but these ARE adjacency. Distance can be constructed from adjacency chains.
  decomposition_resistance: Try defining 'next to' without adjacent, touching, bordering.
    The spatial contact relation resists elimination.
  relevance_to_gaps: Refined from 'location' per CRITIC. More fundamental - location
    is relative position via adjacency.

- label: intentionality
  domain: mind
  proposed_symbol: "\u2192m"
  informal_definition: The aboutness or directedness of mental states; that mental
    states are OF or ABOUT something.
  ostensive_examples:
  - My belief is ABOUT the weather
  - Her desire is FOR chocolate
  - His fear is OF spiders
  negative_examples:
  - Intentionality is not causation - my thought about Paris isn't caused by Paris
  - Intentionality is not physical connection - I can think about unicorns
  primitiveness_argument: To define intentionality, we say 'about', 'of', 'directed
    toward' - but these ARE intentionality.
  decomposition_resistance: Naturalistic reductions either presuppose intentionality
    or change the subject. Aboutness resists elimination.
  relevance_to_gaps: Refined from 'awareness' per CRITIC. More fundamental - awareness
    = intentionality + phenomenality.
  confidence: 0.8

- label: quality
  domain: quality
  proposed_symbol: Q
  informal_definition: The determinable aspect of things that admits of determinate
    values; that things have ways of being that can vary.
  ostensive_examples:
  - This apple has the quality of color with value red
  - The water has the quality of temperature with value hot
  - The sound has the quality of pitch with value high
  negative_examples:
  - Quality is not quantity - how much vs what kind
  - Quality is not relation - qualities are intrinsic
  primitiveness_argument: To define quality, we say 'property', 'attribute', 'way
    of being' - all of which ARE quality.
  decomposition_resistance: Attempts to reduce qualities to relations fail. Red things
    are red, not merely related to redness.
  relevance_to_gaps: Without quality, we cannot express what things are LIKE - their
    intrinsic character.
