role: PROPOSER
iteration: 4
candidates:
- label: quantity
  domain: quantity
  proposed_symbol: '#'
  informal_definition: The aspect of things that answers 'how much' or 'how many';
    the measurable magnitude or countable multitude.
  ostensive_examples:
  - There are THREE apples (discrete quantity)
  - The rope is TWO METERS long (continuous quantity)
  - She has MORE money than him (comparative)
  negative_examples:
  - Quantity is not quality - how much vs what kind
  - Quantity is not identity - equal quantities can be distinct
  primitiveness_argument: To define quantity, we say 'amount', 'magnitude', 'number'
    - all of which ARE quantity.
  decomposition_resistance: Try defining 'how much' without amount, number, degree.
    The quantitative dimension resists elimination.
  relevance_to_gaps: Without quantity, cannot express amounts or measurements. Have
    WHAT KIND but not HOW MUCH.

- label: agency
  domain: action
  proposed_symbol: "\u26A1"
  informal_definition: The capacity to initiate change; being a source of action rather
    than merely undergoing change.
  ostensive_examples:
  - She DECIDED to leave (agent initiating)
  - The cat JUMPED onto the table (animate agency)
  - I CHOSE the red one (deliberate agency)
  negative_examples:
  - Agency is not mere causation - rocks cause but have no agency
  - Agency is not motion - leaves move but have no agency
  primitiveness_argument: To define agency, we say 'initiates', 'does', 'acts' - but
    these ARE agency.
  decomposition_resistance: Agency involves being SOURCE of causal chains, not merely
    a link. Agent/patient distinction resists elimination.
  relevance_to_gaps: Without agency, cannot distinguish actions from mere events.

- label: composition
  domain: relation
  proposed_symbol: "\u228F"
  informal_definition: The part-whole relation; that some things are PARTS OF other
    things, constituting them.
  ostensive_examples:
  - The wheel is PART OF the car
  - The chapter is PART OF the book
  - The cell is PART OF the organism
  negative_examples:
  - Composition is not spatial containment - meanings aren't spatially in sentences
  - Composition is not set membership - my hand is part of me, not member of {me}
  primitiveness_argument: To define composition, we say 'part of', 'constituent of'
    - these ARE composition.
  decomposition_resistance: Part-whole is sui generis. Parts are IN wholes differently
    than set members.
  relevance_to_gaps: Needed for expressing how complex things built from simpler.
    Essential for Leibnizian calculus.
