- candidate_label: quantity
  decomposition:
    attempts:
    - approach: analytic
      attempt: Define as what can be measured
      result: Circular - measurement assigns quantities.
      survived: true
    - approach: synthetic
      attempt: Break into unit + repetition
      result: Only works for discrete. Repetition presupposes counting.
      survived: true
    - approach: functional
      attempt: Define as what numbers represent
      result: Numbers ARE quantities.
      survived: true
    survived: true
    notes: Quantity resists decomposition. 'How much' is primitive.
  circularity:
    concepts_traced:
    - amount
    - magnitude
    - number
    - measure
    - degree

    notes: All traced concepts ARE or presuppose quantity.

    - existence
    - identity
    - negation
    - succession
    - possibility
    - adjacency
    - intentionality
    - quality
    notes: Quality is WHAT KIND, quantity is HOW MUCH. Orthogonal dimensions.

    - case: Discrete vs continuous quantity

    notes: Varieties of quantity, not concept itself.
  cultural_variance:
    evidence_for_universality:
    - All languages have numbers and comparatives
    - Infants have numerosity sense

    notes: Quantity is cognitive universal.
  parsimony:
    expressiveness_value: essential

    notes: Completes descriptive apparatus. Cannot express amounts without it.
  verdict: ACCEPT
  confidence: 0.87
  reasoning_summary: Quantity is primitive. 'How much' orthogonal to quality's 'what
    kind'.
  key_insight: 'Quality and quantity: WHAT KIND and HOW MUCH. Both needed.'

- candidate_label: agency
  decomposition:
    attempts:
    - approach: analytic
      attempt: Define as causation + intentionality
      result: PROMISING - agent = intentional cause. Directed causation.
      survived: false
    - approach: synthetic
      attempt: Break into source of change + goal-directedness
      result: 'Same reduction: causation + intentionality.'
      survived: false
    - approach: functional
      attempt: Define as what distinguishes actions from events
      result: Reduces to 'events with intentional causes'.
      survived: false
    survived: false
    notes: Agency = CAUSATION + INTENTIONALITY. Intentional cause.
  circularity:

    - acts
    - does
    - initiates

    notes: Ordinary circular, but causation + intentionality escapes.
  redundancy:
    can_be_expressed: true
    using_primitives:
    - intentionality
    - possibility
    - succession
    - negation
    notes: Agency = intentional causation. Causation already derivable. Agency = cause
      directed by intentional states.
  edge_cases:

    - case: Unconscious agency
      severity: medium
    - case: Collective agency

    evidence_against: []
    assessment: universal
    notes: Universal but derivable.
  parsimony:
    expressiveness_value: high
    necessary: false
    notes: Agency derivable from existing primitives.
  verdict: REJECT
  confidence: 0.72
  reasoning_summary: Agency = intentional causation. Derivable, not primitive.
  key_insight: Shows existing primitives more powerful than thought!

- candidate_label: composition
  decomposition:
    attempts:
    - approach: analytic
      attempt: Define as spatial containment
      result: Fails - abstract composition exists (meaning in sentence).
      survived: true
    - approach: synthetic
      attempt: Break into identity with fusion of parts
      result: Presupposes composition - 'parts' already mereological.
      survived: true
    - approach: functional
      attempt: Define as set membership
      result: Fails - my hand part of me, not member of {me}.
      survived: true
    survived: true
    notes: Composition sui generis. Part-whole irreducible.
  circularity:
    concepts_traced:
    - part of
    - constituent
    - makes up
    circular_paths: []
    survived: true
    notes: All ARE composition. Mereological primitive.

    - existence

    - negation
    - succession

    - case: Temporal parts
      severity: medium
    - case: Vague composition (sorites)
      severity: medium

    evidence_for_universality:
    - All languages express part-whole

    evidence_against: []
    assessment: universal
    notes: Mereology cognitively fundamental.
  parsimony:
    expressiveness_value: high
    necessary: true
    notes: Essential for structure. Meta-essential - how alphabet works!
  verdict: ACCEPT
  confidence: 0.85
  reasoning_summary: Composition irreducible. Part-whole essential for structure.
  key_insight: 'Meta-essential: complex concepts COMPOSED of primitives. Need mereology.'
