  definition:
    informal: The part-whole relation; that some things are PARTS OF other things,
      constituting them. Composition is how simple things combine into complex wholes.
      It is meta-essential to the alphabet itself - complex concepts are COMPOSED
      of primitives.
    formal: null
  examples:
    ostensive:
    - The wheel is PART OF the car
    - The chapter is PART OF the book
    - The cell is PART OF the organism
    negative:
    - Composition is not spatial containment - meanings are parts of sentences but
      not spatially inside
    - Composition is not set membership - my hand is part of me, not a member of {me}

  notes: 'Tenth primitive. The mereological foundation. Meta-essential: the Leibnizian
    calculus requires composition to express how complex concepts are built from simple
    primitives. The prime product scheme IS compositional.'
