evaluations:
- candidate_label: existence
  decomposition:
    attempts:
    - approach: analytic
      attempt: Define existence as 'having properties' or 'being instantiated'
      result: Fails - 'having' and 'being' both presuppose existence.
      survived: true
    - approach: synthetic
      attempt: Break existence into 'actuality + possibility'
      result: Fails - these are synonyms, not constituents.
      survived: true
    - approach: functional
      attempt: Define existence as 'that which can causally interact'
      result: Partial challenge - abstract objects exist without causal powers.
      survived: true
    survived: true
    notes: All decomposition attempts circle back to existence itself.
  circularity:
    concepts_traced:
    - being
    - is
    - presence
    - reality
    - actuality
    circular_paths: []
    survived: true
    notes: Acceptable primitive circularity - these are synonyms.
  redundancy:
    can_be_expressed: false
    using_primitives: null
    notes: No existing primitives. Existence is foundational.
  edge_cases:
    cases_found:
    - case: Fictional entities
      severity: medium
    - case: Possible worlds
      severity: medium
    overall_severity: medium
    notes: Edge cases concern scope, not the concept itself.
  cultural_variance:
    evidence_for_universality:
    - All languages distinguish being from non-being
    - Infants track object permanence
    evidence_against: []
    assessment: universal
    notes: Existence is perhaps the most universal distinction.
  parsimony:
    expressiveness_value: essential
    necessary: true
    notes: Precondition for all predication.
  verdict: ACCEPT
  confidence: 0.95
  reasoning_summary: Existence survives all attacks. Demonstrably irreducible, universally
    recognized, and absolutely necessary.
  key_insight: The circularity in defining existence is the signature of a true primitive.
  candidate_id: CAND_000_00
- candidate_label: identity
  decomposition:
    attempts:
    - approach: analytic
      attempt: 'Define via Leibniz''s Law: x=y iff same properties'
      result: Fails - applying the law presupposes tracking identity.
      survived: true
    - approach: synthetic
      attempt: Break into same properties + same location
      result: Fails - 'same' just IS identity applied.
      survived: true
    - approach: functional
      attempt: Define as substitutability
      result: Circular - substitutability requires identity.
      survived: true
    survived: true
    notes: Every attempt uses 'same' which IS identity.
  circularity:
    concepts_traced:
    - same
    - identical
    - one
    - selfsame
    circular_paths: []
    survived: true
    notes: Acceptable primitive circularity.
  redundancy:
    can_be_expressed: false
    using_primitives:
    - existence
    notes: Existence alone cannot express identity.
  edge_cases:
    cases_found:
    - case: Ship of Theseus
      severity: medium
    - case: Personal identity
      severity: medium
    overall_severity: medium
    notes: Puzzles about applying identity, not the concept itself.
  cultural_variance:
    evidence_for_universality:
    - All languages express sameness
    - Infant object tracking
    evidence_against: []
    assessment: universal
    notes: Identity is cognitively fundamental.
  parsimony:
    expressiveness_value: essential
    necessary: true
    notes: Required for reference, counting, logic.
  verdict: ACCEPT
  confidence: 0.92
  reasoning_summary: Identity survives all attacks. Demonstrably primitive and essential.
  key_insight: Identity and existence are interdependent foundational concepts.
  candidate_id: CAND_000_01
- candidate_label: difference
  decomposition:
    attempts:
    - approach: analytic
      attempt: Define difference as 'not identical'
      result: SUCCESS - difference = negation(identity). Can be derived.
      survived: false
    - approach: synthetic
      attempt: Break into plurality + distinctness
      result: These are synonyms, not components.
      survived: true
    - approach: functional
      attempt: What allows counting to exceed one
      result: Circular - counting requires differentiating.
      survived: true
    survived: false
    notes: "CRITICAL: Analytic decomposition succeeds. Difference = \xAC(identity)."
  circularity:
    concepts_traced:
    - distinct
    - other
    - not-same
    circular_paths: []
    survived: true
    notes: Trace reveals reduction to negation + identity.
  redundancy:
    can_be_expressed: true
    using_primitives:
    - identity
    - negation
    notes: "x\u2260y = \xAC(x=y). No separate primitive needed."
  edge_cases:
    cases_found:
    - case: Numerical vs qualitative difference
      severity: low
    overall_severity: low
    notes: Manageable edge cases.
  cultural_variance:
    evidence_for_universality:
    - All languages distinguish same from different
    evidence_against: []
    assessment: universal
    notes: Universal but not primitive.
  parsimony:
    expressiveness_value: high
    necessary: false
    notes: Expressible via identity + negation.
  verdict: REJECT
  confidence: 0.85
  reasoning_summary: Difference fails primitiveness - can be expressed as negation
    of identity.
  key_insight: This reveals NEGATION as a candidate primitive we should propose next.
