candidates:
- label: existence
  domain: being
  proposed_symbol: "\u2203"
  informal_definition: The bare fact that something IS rather than is not; the positive
    presence of being as opposed to nothingness
  ostensive_examples:
  - This rock exists - it is here, present, real
  - The number 7 exists as a mathematical object
  - My pain right now exists - it is occurring
  negative_examples:
  - A married bachelor does not exist - it is logically impossible
  - Phlogiston turned out not to exist - it was a mistaken posit
  primitiveness_argument: Any attempt to define existence uses concepts that presuppose
    existence. To say something 'is real' or 'is present' or 'occurs' already assumes
    the concept of being/existence. It is the ground-floor concept upon which all
    others rest.
  decomposition_resistance: When you try to break down existence, you find yourself
    saying 'to exist is to be...' but 'be' IS existence. Every synonym circles back.
    This is the mark of a true primitive - you cannot escape it.
  relevance_to_gaps: Without existence, we cannot express that anything IS. It is
    the precondition for all other predicates - nothing can be located, caused, or
    thought unless it first exists.

- label: identity
  domain: relation
  proposed_symbol: "\u2261"
  informal_definition: The relation that each thing bears to itself and to nothing
    else; that a thing is the same as itself
  ostensive_examples:
  - The Morning Star is identical to the Evening Star (both are Venus)
  - Mark Twain is identical to Samuel Clemens
  - This chair now is the same chair as this chair now
  negative_examples:
  - Similarity is not identity - two red balls are similar but not identical
  - Equality of properties is not identity - two electrons may be indistinguishable
    yet numerically distinct
  primitiveness_argument: 'To define identity requires saying ''x is the same as y''
    but ''same'' just IS identity. All attempts at definition (Leibniz''s law: x=y
    iff they share all properties) presuppose we can re-identify the relata, which
    requires identity.'
  decomposition_resistance: Philosophers have tried to reduce identity to indiscernibility
    (sharing all properties), but evaluating indiscernibility requires tracking which
    object we're asking about - which presupposes identity. The circle is unbreakable.
  relevance_to_gaps: Without identity, we cannot express that something persists through
    change, that two names refer to the same thing, or that we are counting correctly.
    It undergirds all predication and quantification.

- label: difference
  domain: relation
  proposed_symbol: "\u2262"
  informal_definition: The relation of being non-identical; that one thing is NOT
    the same as another
  ostensive_examples:
  - This apple is different from that orange
  - The number 2 is different from the number 3
  - Today is different from yesterday
  negative_examples:
  - Difference is not mere dissimilarity - identical twins are different persons despite
    maximal similarity
  - Difference is not opposition - up and down are opposed, but that's a specific
    kind of difference
  primitiveness_argument: While difference might seem definable as 'not identical',
    this just pushes the primitiveness to negation and identity. But difference may
    be as primitive as identity - you cannot grasp identity without implicitly grasping
    what it means for things to NOT be identical.
  decomposition_resistance: Try defining difference without using 'not the same',
    'distinct', 'other', 'separate' - all of which ARE difference under other names.
    The concept resists exit.
  relevance_to_gaps: Without difference, we cannot express plurality, diversity, or
    change. If we only had identity, everything would collapse into one. Difference
    is the conceptual wedge that allows multiplicity.
