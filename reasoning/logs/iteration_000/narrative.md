# Iteration 0: The Founding

**Date**: 2026-01-18
**Phase**: EXPANSION
**Strategy**: DOMAIN_SWEEP (being, space, time, causation, mind)
**Reasoning Engine**: Claude Session (interactive)

## Summary

This iteration marks the beginning of Project Alphabetum - an attempt to reconstruct Leibniz's Alphabet of Human Thought using AI-assisted philosophical reasoning.

**Results**:
- **Candidates Proposed**: 3
- **Candidates Accepted**: 2
- **Candidates Rejected**: 1
- **Acceptance Rate**: 67%

## The Candidates

### 1. EXISTENCE (ACCEPTED)

The PROPOSER suggested **existence** as the most fundamental primitive - the bare fact that something IS rather than is not.

The CRITIC applied all six attacks:
- **Decomposition**: All attempts circular - you cannot define "is" without using "is"
- **Redundancy**: Cannot be expressed from nothing - it IS the foundation
- **Cultural Variance**: Universal across all known languages and cultures
- **Parsimony**: Essential - without it, nothing can be predicated

**Verdict**: ACCEPT with 0.95 confidence

**Key Insight**: The circularity in defining existence is not a bug but the signature of a true primitive. When all roads lead back to the same concept, you have found bedrock.

### 2. IDENTITY (ACCEPTED)

The PROPOSER suggested **identity** - the relation each thing bears to itself and nothing else.

The CRITIC's analysis:
- **Decomposition**: Leibniz's Law (x=y iff same properties) presupposes identity to apply
- **Redundancy**: Existence alone cannot express identity
- **Edge Cases**: Ship of Theseus etc. are puzzles about criteria, not the concept itself

**Verdict**: ACCEPT with 0.92 confidence

**Key Insight**: Identity and existence are interdependent - to say something exists is to say there is at least one thing identical to itself.

### 3. DIFFERENCE (REJECTED)

The PROPOSER suggested **difference** - the relation of non-identity.

The CRITIC's analysis revealed a critical failure:
- **Decomposition Attack SUCCEEDED**: Difference = NOT(Identity)
- If we have identity and negation, we can derive difference
- Therefore, difference is NOT a primitive

**Verdict**: REJECT with 0.85 confidence

**Key Insight**: This rejection is productive! It reveals that **NEGATION** is likely a true primitive we need to propose. The system is working - we're learning from failures.

## The Alphabet After Iteration 0

| ID | Label | Domain | Symbol | Prime |
|----|-------|--------|--------|-------|
| P001 | existence | being | ∃ | 2 |
| P002 | identity | relation | ≡ | 3 |

## Implications for Next Iteration

1. **NEGATION** should be proposed as a candidate (revealed by the difference rejection)
2. We have foundational ontological concepts but lack:
   - Logical connectives (especially negation)
   - Spatial/temporal concepts
   - Causal concepts
   - Mental concepts

The DOMAIN_SWEEP strategy should continue, but the gap identified (negation) takes priority.

## Philosophical Reflection

We have begun with the absolute fundamentals: that things *exist*, and that they are *identical to themselves*. These two primitives, combined with the yet-to-be-established concept of negation, will allow us to express:

- **Existence + Identity**: "There is an x that is x" (something exists)
- **Existence + Identity + Negation**: "There is an x and a y such that x ≠ y" (plurality exists)

The Leibnizian calculus begins to take shape. Each primitive is assigned a prime number:
- existence = 2
- identity = 3

Complex concepts will be products of their constituents. For example, if we accept negation (prime 5), then:
- "non-existence" = 2 × 5 = 10
- "difference" = 3 × 5 = 15

The dream of a calculus ratiocinator advances.
