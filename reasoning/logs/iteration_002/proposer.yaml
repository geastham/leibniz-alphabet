role: PROPOSER
iteration: 2
candidates:
- label: possibility
  domain: being
  proposed_symbol: "\u25C7"
  informal_definition: The modal status of what could be but is not necessarily so;
    that which is not impossible. Possibility marks the space of what might exist
    beyond what actually does.
  ostensive_examples:
  - It is possible that it will rain tomorrow
  - A circle could have been drawn larger
  - I could have chosen differently
  negative_examples:
  - Possibility is not probability - possible doesn't mean likely
  - Possibility is not actuality - what's possible may never happen
  primitiveness_argument: To define possibility, we say 'could be' or 'might be' -
    but these ARE possibility. The modal circle is unbreakable.
  decomposition_resistance: 'Every attempt uses modal language: might, could, can.
    Even ''consistent'' means possibly true together.'
  relevance_to_gaps: 'Critical gap from iteration 1: causation requires counterfactuals,
    which require possibility.'

- label: location
  domain: space
  proposed_symbol: '@'
  informal_definition: The spatial relation of occupying a position; being somewhere
    rather than nowhere. Location is the basic spatial fact.
  ostensive_examples:
  - The book is on the table
  - Paris is in France
  - The electron is in the left detector
  negative_examples:
  - Location is not identity - things can be co-located
  - Location is not extension - size differs from position
  primitiveness_argument: To define location, we use 'where', 'at', 'in' - all spatial
    terms that presuppose location.
  decomposition_resistance: Try defining 'where' without place, position, at, in,
    here, there. You cannot escape spatial indexicality.
  relevance_to_gaps: Alphabet has time but not space. Location opens the spatial dimension.

- label: awareness
  domain: mind
  proposed_symbol: "\u2299"
  informal_definition: The basic mental fact of something being present to a subject;
    phenomenal consciousness or 'what it is like' to experience.
  ostensive_examples:
  - I am aware of this red color right now
  - The pain is present to my consciousness
  - There is something it is like to see blue
  negative_examples:
  - Awareness is not information processing - computers process without awareness
  - Awareness is not attention - we are aware of things we don't attend to
  primitiveness_argument: To define awareness, we use 'experience', 'consciousness',
    'phenomenal' - all of which ARE awareness under other names.
  decomposition_resistance: Every reduction either smuggles in awareness or changes
    the subject. The hard problem exists because awareness resists reduction.
  relevance_to_gaps: Alphabet lacks the mental. Awareness opens the phenomenal dimension.
