  definition:
    informal: The modal status of what could be but is not necessarily so; that which
      is not impossible. Possibility marks the space of alternatives to actuality
      - what might exist or occur beyond what actually does.
    formal: null
  examples:
    ostensive:
    - It is possible that it will rain tomorrow
    - A circle could have been drawn larger
    - I could have chosen differently
    negative:
    - Possibility is not probability - possible doesn't mean likely
    - Possibility is not actuality - what's possible may never happen

  notes: 'Fifth primitive. Opens the modal dimension. Enables expressing counterfactuals,
    abilities, and alternatives. With possibility, causation becomes expressible:
    C causes E iff succession(C,E) AND possibility(NOT-C implies NOT-E).'
