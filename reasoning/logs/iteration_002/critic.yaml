evaluations:
- candidate_label: possibility
  decomposition:
    attempts:
    - approach: analytic
      attempt: Define as 'not necessarily false'
      result: Circular - 'necessarily' is modal.
      survived: true
    - approach: synthetic
      attempt: Break into possible worlds (Lewis)
      result: Relocates rather than eliminates. 'Possible world' contains 'possible'.
      survived: true
    - approach: functional
      attempt: Define as what physics permits
      result: Too narrow. 'Permit' is modal.
      survived: true
    survived: true
    notes: Modal circle unbreakable. Every definition uses possibility or necessity.

    concepts_traced:
    - could
    - might
    - can
    - able
    - consistent
    circular_paths: []
    survived: true
    notes: All modal concepts. Signature of a primitive.
  redundancy:
    can_be_expressed: false
    using_primitives:
    - existence
    - identity
    - negation
    - succession
    notes: Current alphabet is purely actual. Possibility adds modal dimension.
  edge_cases:
    cases_found:
    - case: Epistemic vs metaphysical possibility
      severity: medium
    overall_severity: medium
    notes: Concern types of possibility, not core concept.
  cultural_variance:
    evidence_for_universality:
    - All languages have modal expressions
    - Counterfactual reasoning universal
    evidence_against: []
    assessment: universal
    notes: Modal thinking fundamental to planning.
  parsimony:
    expressiveness_value: essential
    necessary: true
    notes: Unlocks counterfactuals, abilities, alternatives.
  verdict: ACCEPT
  confidence: 0.92
  reasoning_summary: Possibility is primitive - modal circle unbreakable. Essential
    for counterfactuals.
  key_insight: "With possibility, causation becomes expressible: C causes E iff \u25C7\
    (\xACC) \u2192 \u25C7(\xACE)."

- candidate_label: location
  decomposition:
    attempts:
    - approach: analytic
      attempt: Define as spatial relations to other objects (relationism)
      result: Partial success - location might be bundle of spatial relations.
      survived: false
    - approach: synthetic
      attempt: Break into distance + direction from reference
      result: Presupposes spatial framework.
      survived: true
    - approach: functional
      attempt: Define as where causal interactions occur
      result: Circular - interactions happen AT locations.
      survived: true
    survived: false
    notes: Relational analysis has force. Location might reduce to spatial relations.
  circularity:
    concepts_traced:
    - where
    - at
    - in
    - place
    - position
    circular_paths: []
    survived: true
    notes: Ordinary definitions circular, but relational analysis offers escape.
  redundancy:
    can_be_expressed: true
    using_primitives:
    - SPATIAL_RELATION
    - identity
    notes: Location = bundle of spatial relations.
  edge_cases:
    cases_found:
    - case: Quantum non-locality
      severity: high
    - case: Abstract objects
      severity: medium
    overall_severity: high
    notes: Physics challenges naive location concepts.
  cultural_variance:
    evidence_for_universality:
    - All languages have spatial deixis
    evidence_against: []
    assessment: universal
    notes: Universal but physics challenges naive conception.
  parsimony:
    expressiveness_value: high
    necessary: false
    notes: Need spatial primitive, but ADJACENCY or EXTENSION might be more fundamental.
  verdict: REFINE
  confidence: 0.65
  reasoning_summary: Location may not be the right spatial primitive. Consider ADJACENCY
    instead.
  key_insight: Need spatial primitive, but should consider ADJACENCY or EXTENSION
    as alternatives.

- candidate_label: awareness
  decomposition:
    attempts:
    - approach: analytic
      attempt: Define as information processing
      result: Fails - thermostat processes but isn't aware.
      survived: true
    - approach: synthetic
      attempt: Break into intentionality + phenomenality
      result: May succeed - these might be separable primitives.
      survived: false
    - approach: functional
      attempt: Define as what makes processing into experiencing
      result: Circular - experiencing IS awareness.
      survived: true
    survived: false
    notes: Awareness might factor into INTENTIONALITY + PHENOMENALITY.
  circularity:
    concepts_traced:
    - consciousness
    - experience
    - phenomenal
    - qualia
    circular_paths: []
    survived: true
    notes: All synonyms, but intentionality/phenomenality distinction offers decomposition.
  redundancy:
    can_be_expressed: true
    using_primitives:
    - INTENTIONALITY
    - PHENOMENALITY
    notes: Awareness = intentional + phenomenal state.
  edge_cases:
    cases_found:
    - case: Blindsight - intentionality without phenomenality
      severity: high
    - case: Unconscious perception
      severity: medium
    overall_severity: high
    notes: Blindsight suggests awareness is composite.
  cultural_variance:
    evidence_for_universality:
    - All cultures distinguish conscious from unconscious
    evidence_against:
    - Concepts vary across traditions
    assessment: mostly universal
    notes: Core phenomenon universal but conceptualization varies.
  parsimony:
    expressiveness_value: high
    necessary: false
    notes: INTENTIONALITY might be more fundamental than awareness.
  verdict: REFINE
  confidence: 0.6
  reasoning_summary: Awareness may decompose into intentionality + phenomenality.
    Consider INTENTIONALITY as more primitive.
  key_insight: Mental domain needs exploration. INTENTIONALITY (aboutness) may be
    more fundamental.
