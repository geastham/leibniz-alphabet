label: phenomenality
domain: mind
symbol: "\u2609"
prime_number: 37
definition:
  informal: The qualitative, experiential character of conscious states - what it
    is LIKE to have an experience. The felt quality of being a subject, irreducible
    to functional, representational, or informational descriptions.
  formal: null
examples:
  ostensive:
  - The redness of seeing red (not the wavelength, but the felt quality)
  - The painfulness of pain (not the signal, but the suffering)
  - The taste experience of coffee (not the chemistry, but the flavor-feel)
  - The felt difference between imagining and perceiving
  negative:
  - Information processing without experience (a thermostat detects temperature but has no phenomenality)
  - Functional roles alone (a zombie could have identical functions without phenomenality)
  - Behavioral dispositions (what it does vs what it's like)

notes: Twelfth primitive. Opens the phenomenal/experiential dimension. The hard problem
  of consciousness is hard precisely because phenomenality resists reduction. With
  phenomenality, we can derive awareness (phenomenality + intentionality) and alterity
  (intentionality toward phenomenality in non-self).
