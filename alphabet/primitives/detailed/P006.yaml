id: P006
label: adjacency
domain: space
symbol: "\u22A3"
prime_number: 13
definition:
  informal: The basic spatial relation of being next to or touching; immediate spatial
    proximity without intervening space. Adjacency is the atomic spatial relation
    from which distance and location can be constructed.
  formal: null
examples:
  ostensive:
  - This brick is adjacent to that brick (touching)
  - France is adjacent to Germany (sharing a border)
  - Neighboring cells in a grid
  negative:
  - Adjacency is not identity - adjacent things are distinct
  - Adjacency is not overlap - adjacent things touch but don't interpenetrate
relationships:

confidence: 0.88
status: stable
notes: Sixth primitive. Opens the spatial dimension. Adjacency is to space what succession
  is to time - the basic ordering relation. Location and distance can be derived from
  adjacency chains.
