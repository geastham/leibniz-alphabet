label: negation
domain: relation
symbol: "\xAC"
prime_number: 5
definition:
  informal: The logical operation that reverses truth value; the concept of NOT. When
    applied to any proposition or concept, it yields its opposite or denial. Negation
    is the gateway to expressing absence, difference, and falsity.
  formal: null
examples:
  ostensive:
  - It is NOT raining (the denial of 'it is raining')
  - This is not-red (the absence of redness)
  - Non-existence (the negation of existence)
  negative:
  - Negation is not mere absence - empty space is not negation
  - Negation is not opposition - hot vs cold are opposites but neither IS negation

  \ (\xAC\u2203), difference (\xAC\u2261), and denial of any property."
